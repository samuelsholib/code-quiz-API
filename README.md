### ToDo

```
At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I will be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize my self with these tests and allow my self to use some of the skills I have learned I wanted do a new project that is timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
```

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
